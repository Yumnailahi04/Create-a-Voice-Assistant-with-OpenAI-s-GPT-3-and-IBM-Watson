# Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAIs GPT 3 and IBM Watson 🤗🤗🤗
#### A voice assistant is a software agent that can interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. voice assistants aim to be an intelligent virtual assistant accessible through voice interactions to help consumers accomplish myriad tasks via conversational AI capabilities. 
#### GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, is an auto-regressive language model created by OpenAI in 2020. OpenAI is a research organization that aims to promote and develop friendly artificial intelligence in a way that benefits humanity as a whole. 
#### IBM Watson Embeddable AI simplifies bringing Watson's AI services directly into third-party environments and applications via turnkey toolkits and APIs. These technologies allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice input and output.
#### This project aims to instruct and lead us through the implementation of OpenAI's advanced language processing technology and IBM Watson Embeddable AI in building our own voice assistant.
